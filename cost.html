          For the 30 day sprint, the cost is intentionally boring.
          We fund two things only, physical listening points, and stewardship time.

      <main>
        <h2>30 day sprint, indicative range</h2>
        <p><strong>£1,500 to £2,000</strong> all in, depending on disc volume and cadence.</p>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h2>What this covers</h2>
        <p><strong>1) Physical listening layer</strong></p>
        <p class="muted">
          Microsuction discs and entry points in everyday spaces, kitchens, mirrors, noticeboards, lanyards,
          libraries, cafés, community venues. These are not promotional, they are neighbourhood listening infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2) Stewardship</strong></p>
        <p class="muted">
          Weekly interpretation, light coordination, and a short public-facing “what we heard and how we responded” brief.
          This keeps the loop closed and prevents drift into inert insight.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          No licences. No procurement dependency. No integration work.
          Just a timeboxed practice of safe listening and gentle response.
        </div>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h2>What this does not cover</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          Clinical triage, case management, targeted campaigns, individual tracking, or anything that requires personal data.
        </p>
      </main>

      <footer>
        If you need a line-item breakdown for an internal paper, keep it simple: discs, and stewardship time.
