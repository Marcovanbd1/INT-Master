        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>
          Neighbourhood Signals is a way for a place to notice what people are trying to find help with, and how that shifts week to week,
          using aggregate digital behaviour as a clue.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          It’s not a patient list. It’s not risk scoring. It’s not a surveillance product.
          It’s a shared civic picture of emerging pressure, held with humility and used for gentle coordination.
        </p>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h2>The loop</h2>
        <p class="muted">Signals only works safely when the loop is closed.</p>
        <div class="loop" aria-label="Core loop">
          <div class="step">Listen</div><div class="arrow">→</div>
          <div class="step">Understand</div><div class="arrow">→</div>
          <div class="step">Interpret</div><div class="arrow">→</div>
          <div class="step">Respond</div>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
          “Respond” here means small, reversible actions that reduce confusion and improve access.
          Not targeting. Not case management. Not behavioural nudging.
        </div>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h2>The 30 day listening sprint</h2>
        <p>
          This is not a procurement and not a platform rollout.
          It’s a lightweight, timeboxed way to practise listening together, then publishing what we heard and what we did.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          No integration. No personal data. No profiling.
          Just shared interpretation and gentle response.
        </p>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h2>This doesn’t scale, and it’s not a roll-out</h2>
        <p>
          Growth is not replication. Neighbourhoods don’t sound the same.
          So new areas don’t “adopt a tool”, they commission stewardship and grow their own listening loop safely.
        </p>

          The rest of this site exists to answer the predictable questions cleanly, without turning this into a product story.
